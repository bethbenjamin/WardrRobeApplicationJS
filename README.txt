I implemented javascript on this page using the following: 
1.INDEX HOME:  body onload="Greeting()"  It greets the user and allows them to input their name.

2.INDEX HOME:  id="home" onmouseover="mouseOver()" onmouseout="mouseOut().  When user mouses over the Welcome message, 
it changes to light blue and then back to white.

3.Layout page: function redirect - this function allows users to leave the page to 'shop now'.  

4. Tops page: Hide function - i have added an animation that can be 'hidden' with the close button.

5. Layout page: swap text function - it allows user to hover over text (copyright date) and swap for alternate text.  
After the user leaves the section, it returns to original text.

6. INDEX Home: User can hover over TOPS and switch it to smaller font gray.  Once user leaves it goes back to original state.

7. INDEX HOME page: originally added to layout, but it was so annoying to see on everypage load thereafter...
Homework portion added ONCAN PLAY. Alert box indicating the content has been loaded and is read
to play.  When user clicks the audio will play.  At the end another alert box will show stating the audio has finished.
