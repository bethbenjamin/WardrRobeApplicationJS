I implemented javascript on this page using the following: 
1.INDEX HOME:  body onload="Greeting()"  It greets the user and allows them to input their name.
2.INDEX HOME:  id="home" onmouseover="mouseOver()" onmouseout="mouseOut().  When user mouses over the Welcome message, it changes to light blue and then back to white.
3.
