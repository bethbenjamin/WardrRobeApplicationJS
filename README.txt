I implemented javascript on this page using the following: 
1.INDEX HOME:  body onload="Greeting()"  It greets the user and allows them to input their name.

2.INDEX HOME:  id="home" onmouseover="mouseOver()" onmouseout="mouseOut().  When user mouses over the Welcome message, 
it changes to light blue and then back to white.

3.Layout page: function redirect - this function allows users to leave the page to 'shop now'.  

4. Tops page: Hide function - i have added an animation that can be 'hidden' with the close button.
